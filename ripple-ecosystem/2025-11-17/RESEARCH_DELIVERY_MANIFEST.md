## RESEARCH GAPS & LIMITATIONS

### Current Limitations Identified

1. **No Single Comprehensive Platform**
   - XRP lacks all-in-one solution like some EVM chains
   - Multi-platform approach necessary

2. **Arkham Intelligence XRP Support**
   - Dominant on EVM chains
   - XRP support not confirmed in research
   - Recommendation: Verify directly with platform

3. **Address Clustering**
   - Not as advanced as Bitcoin/Ethereum
   - XRP destination tags provide alternative approach
   - Academic methods available but not commercialized

4. **Paid Features**
   - Advanced analytics require premium subscriptions
   - Free tier sufficient for basic signals
   - Upgrade path clearly defined

5. **Data Completeness**
   - Historical data varies by platform
   - Real-time data consistent across sources
   - Academic datasets available for deep research

### Recommendations for Further Development

- [x] Quarterly platform review (new tools emerge)
- [x] Monitor emerging XRPL-specific analytics
- [x] Test cross-chain whale tracking capability
